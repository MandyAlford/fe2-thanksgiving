# Thankgiving Break Resources

This repo contains some extra resources for studying over the 2019 Thanksgiving Break.

You are not expected to be working on projects during the week off. Rather, you are encouraged to work through some exercises, do readings, and watch some videos to kep up your reps while away from the basement. We would recommend putting in a average to 2 - 3 hours per day studying.
